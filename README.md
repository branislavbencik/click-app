Implementation notes:

- top 10 clickers picture is self-made in Adobe Illustrator

Things I tried and took me so long till I gave up on them and choosed faster (not good practice) way:

- combineReducers(),
- some typescript types

Things I tried to find solution and unfortunately didn't find:

- how to dynamically highlights row for a current team

I wish I had more time for:

- some CSS preprocessor
- to learn some server setting for deploying to heroku (my try: https://damp-forest-23706.herokuapp.com/ )

It was quite challenging to deep dive in all new technologies. Before this assigment I just watched some basic React online tutorials and coding along with tutor, never made any React app by myself before, never tried Redux, Typescript, didn't know how API request works etc. Thank you, Applifting, for this interesting experience.
