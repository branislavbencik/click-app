Implementation notes:

- top 10 clickers picture is self-made in Adobe Illustrator

Things I tried and took me so long till I gave up on them and choosed faster (not good practice) way:
- combineReducers(),
- some typescript types

Things I tried to find solution and unfortunately didn't find:
- how to dynamically highlights row for a current team

I wish I had more time for:

- some CSS preprocessor
- to learn some server setting for deploying to heroku (my try: https://damp-forest-23706.herokuapp.com/ )
